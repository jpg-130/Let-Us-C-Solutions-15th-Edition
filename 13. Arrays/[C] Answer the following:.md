# [C] Answer the following:

(a) An array is a collection of:

1. Different data types scattered throughout memory
2. The same data type scattered throughout memory
3. The same data type placed next to each other in memory
4. Different data types placed next to each other in memory

````
3. The same data type placed next to each other in memory
````

(b) Are the following array declarations correct?

````c
int a (25) ;
````

**INCORRECT**. `int a [25] ;`

````c
int size = 10, b[ size ] ;
````

**CORRECT**.

````c
int c = { 0,1,2 } ;
````

**INCORRECT**. `int c[] = {0, 1, 2} ;`

(c) Which element of the array does this expression reference?

    num[ 4 ]

`5th element.`

(d) What is the difference between the 5â€™s in these two expressions? (Select the correct answer)

    int num[ 5 ] ;

    num[ 5 ] = 11 ;

1. First is particular element, second is type
2. First is array size, second is particular element
3. First is particular element, second is array size
4. Both specify array size

````
2. First is array size, second is particular element
````

(e) State whether the following statements are True or False:

1. The array **int num[ 26 ]** has twenty-six elements.

   ==> **True**

2. The expression **num[ 1 ]** designates the first element in the array.

   ==> **False**

3. It is necessary to initialize the array at the time of declaration.

   ==> **False**

4. The expression **num[ 27 ]** designates the twenty-eighth element in the array.

   ==> **True**
