# [G] Fill in the blanks:

(a) In y = 10 * x / 2 + z ; `10*x` operation will be performed first.

(b) If a is an integer variable, a = 11 / 2 ; will store `5` in a.

(c) The expression, a = 22 / 7 * 5 / 3 ; would evaluate to `5`.

(d) The expression x = -7 % 2 - 8 would evaluate to `-9`.

(e) If d is a float the operation d = 2 / 7.0 would store `0.285714` in d.
