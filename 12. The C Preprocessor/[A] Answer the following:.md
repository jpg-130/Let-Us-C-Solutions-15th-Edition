# [A] Answer the following:

(a) A preprocessor directive is:

1. A message from compiler to the programmer
2. A message from compiler to the linker

3. A message from programmer to the preprocessor
4. A message from programmer to the microprocessor

````
3. A message from programmer to the preprocessor
````

(b) Which of the following are correctly formed #define statements:

#define INCH PER FEET 12

#define SQR (X) ( X * X )

#define SQR(X) X * X

#define SQR(X) ( X * X )

````
#define SQR(X) ( X * X )
````

(c) State True or False:

1. A macro must always be written in capital letters.

   ==> **False**

2. A macro should always be accommodated in a single line.

   ==> **False**

3. After preprocessing when the program is sent for compilation the macros are removed from the expanded source code.

   ==> **True**

4. Macros with arguments are not allowed.

   ==> **False**

5. Nested macros are allowed.

   ==> **False**

6. In a macro call the control is passed to the macro.

   ==> **False**

(d) How many **#include** directives can be there in a given program file?

````
You can put any number of #include directives in a given program file
````

(e) What is the difference between the following two **#include** directives:

#include "conio.h"

#include <conio.h>

````
#include "conio.h" : This will search the header file in the current directory as well as the specified list od directories

#include <conio.h> : This will search the header file only in the specified list of directories
````

(f) A header file is:

1. A file that contains standard library functions
2. A file that contains definitions and macros
3. A file that contains user-defined functions
4. A file that is present in current working directory

````
2. A file that contains definitions and macros
````

(g) Which of the following is not a preprocessor directive

1. #if
2. #elseif
3. #undef
4. #pragma

````
2. #elseif
````

(h) All macro substitutions in a program are done:

1. Before compilation of the program
2. After compilation
3. During execution
4. None of the above

````
1. Before compilation of the program
````

(i) In a program the statement:

#include "filename"

is replaced by the contents of the file “filename”:

1. Before compilation
2. After Compilation
3. During execution
4. None of the above

````
1. Before compilation
````
