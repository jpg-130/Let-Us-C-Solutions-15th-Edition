# [C] State whether the following statements are True or False:

(a) Storage for a register storage class variable is allocated each time the control reaches the block in which it is present.

==> **True**

(b) An extern storage class variable is not available to the functions that precede its definition, unless the variable is explicitly declared in these functions.

==> **True**

(c) The value of an automatic storage class variable persists between various function invocations.

==> **False**

(d) If the CPU registers are not available, the register storage class variables are treated as static storage class variables.

==> **False**

(e) The register storage class variables cannot hold float values.

==> **True**

(f) If we try to use register storage class for a **float** variable the compiler will report an error message.

==> **False**

(g) If the variable **x** is defined outside all functions and a variable **x** is also defined as a local variable of some function, then the global variable gets preference over the local variable.

==> **False**

(h) The default value for automatic variable is zero.

==> **False**

(i) The life of static variable is till the control remains within the block in which it is defined.

==> **False**

(j) If a global variable is to be defined, then the **extern** keyword is necessary in its declaration.

==> **False**

(k) The address of register variable is not accessible.

==> **True**

(l) A variable that is defined outside all functions can also have a static **storage** class.

==> **True**

(m) One variable can have multiple storage classes.

==> **False**
